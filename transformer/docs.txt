Transformer Function

If we need to change the anything related to the grids
- number of boxes
- location of the grids
- size of the grids
- how far Louisville spans 
- excluding boxes in the grid to query in
Please follow the following steps to get a new set of coordinates

Steps:

1. Ensure that your python environment has pandas and pyproj installed
If you are unsure of how to do this, look into documentation on using pip to install

2. Ensure that you can access the following link:
https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?url=https://services1.arcgis.com/79kfd2K6fskCAkyg/ArcGIS/rest/services/Jefferson_County_Grid/FeatureServer/0&source=sd
If you can not access this, please contact someone from the arcGIS team to make this information public
		
3. Delete the existing coordinates.csv file

4. Now, go ahead and run the transformer function. If everything goes smoothly, you should see the words:
"Transformed CSV saved to" followed by the same path where your run_results.py is 
Please check that folder for the new coordinates.csv file

Debugging:

1. If you see an error mention: No data available for transformation or "Failed to load ArcGIS data
Please make sure that the link in the transformer function points to the correct location. If the grid has been moved to a different address, this link should be updated in the transformer.py and in this documentation

2. If you see any errors regarding permission: Try running your application (Visual Studio, terminal, etc) in admin mode.
Also delete any old files in the current folder that are unrelated or not necessary. We should only need the transformer.py
file to generate this

3. If you don't think that the code is properly picking up the new values, please ensure that the coordinates.csv file has been properly
replaced and then try rebuilding your project/solution. In Visual Studio, this is done by right clicking the project at the top of the
solution explorer, and then clicking rebuild
