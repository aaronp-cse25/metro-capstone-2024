Introduction

The project involves manipulating and processing location data using Google’s Places API, focusing on identifying businesses relevant to tobacco and related products in Louisville Metro. The primary goals of the code are to interact with a database stored in a CSV file, convert this data into a 2D-like structure for memory storage and manipulation, and perform API calls to gather additional information, such as place details and reviews.

The Places API plays a crucial role in querying and identifying relevant locations, such as convenience stores, gas stations, and tobacco shops. These locations are filtered based on certain criteria and further analyzed by extracting their details, reviews, and addresses. The project also involves matching addresses from different datasets using string comparison techniques.

In essence, the project aims to streamline the data handling process, enhance data accuracy, and provide meaningful insights by matching and categorizing locations based on their reviews and addresses. The integration of tools like Pandas, Pickle, and IO libraries ensures that the data is handled efficiently, while the Places API allows for real-time and precise location-based queries.

The purpose of the code is to create a dataframe for the existing database, initially stored in a .CSV file, and manipulate the data to fit the project’s needs. The code will convert the database into a 2D-like structure that allows the program to interact with it. Then, the code that handles the database needs to ensure that the converted data is to be stored in memory for other files to use the data that is outside of the code which initialized the action of converting the database into necessary structure. The libraries included in this program are “Pandas”, “Pickle”, and “IO”. “Pandas” allows the code to construct the entries in the .CSV file into a structure that can be read as a 2D-like structure that can be readable through the console with pandas’ functionality to read a truncated part of the database. The “Pickle” library allows the program to save a database onto the disk for later use through memory. Also, it allows other files to use the database without an intermediate method such as saving the result into another .CSV file. The direction of this part of the project will be tested with Louisville Metro’s tobacco license database and the text searches provided by other parts.
